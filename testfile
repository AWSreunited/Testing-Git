this is a test file
it will be pushed onto github repository "Testing-Git" from Seoul ec2 instance
it has been pulled by the Tokyo ec2 instance.
I didn't config user name and email in the last commit
Now I have pulled testfile again from github test repo and now config user and email.
Let's see what name it shows on github commit. last time it was root.
if it works it must be Saqib Rafiq this time.
